A linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
Class: Search algorithm
Worst-case space complexity: O(1) iterative
Best-case performance: O(1)
Average performance: O(n/2)

// Algorithm 
Start from the leftmost element of given arr[] and one by one compare element x with each element of arr[]

If x matches with any of the element, return the index value.

If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements in arr[] , return -1 or element not found.

// Code
def linearsearch(arr, x):
   for i in range(len(arr)):
      if arr[i] == x:
         return i
   return -1
arr = ['t','u','t','o','r','i','a','l']
x = 'a'
print("element found at index "+str(linearsearch(arr,x)))
